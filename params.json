The user first makes a regulatory decision as a commissioner in the NFL that will affect a player on the field playing a game. After the choice is made, the player will respectively encounter a situation where they either receive or do not receive a concussion, following with socially relevant outcomes. By simulating the concussion with head jerking, adjusting camera blurs, and an unpredictable audio, the condition the player is in depends completely on the choices of the user. We also present the situation in a social context with the effect the medical condition has on familial relationships. Through exploring concussions through a first person perspective, our project accurately leverages VR and aids the user in understanding what it is like to experience and go through such an injury. A relevant article related to our social topic can be found [here](http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/concussions-rise-nfl-league-data-reveals-article-1.2513828).\r\n\r\n#The scientifically supported data that supports the results of user choices\r\nIn order to accurately represent the impact concussions have on people, we did some research and uncovered common symptoms and reported visual stigma that can indicate the person had received the injury. These common symptoms included but were not limited to ([from this link] (http://www.brainline.org/content/2012/06/what-you-need-to-know-symptoms-of-concussion.html)):\r\n\r\n* Light-headedness, dizziness, or loss of balance\r\n* Increased sensitivity to lights, sounds, or distractions\r\n* Blurred vision or eyes that tire easily\r\n* Ringing in the ears\r\n\r\nThe above stimuli were able to be leveraged in Google Cardboard by adjusting the camera effects and audio to match the symptoms. As a result, these scientifically reported symptoms shows results of the user getting a concussion due to playing in the game.\r\n\r\n# Why VR? \r\nOur topic addresses social issues in a context that directly affects the fate of NFL players. Seeing what the player goes through during and after a traumatic brain injury gives the user a look into health affecting sports with a current issue and the effects that these symptoms can have on loved ones.\r\n\r\n#Sources\r\nConference room model: https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=f08748ae18c68a55ae2253302cadc4cd\r\n\r\nMan: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/51662\r\n\r\nCoffee Mug: https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=b7841572364fd9ce1249ffc39a0c3c0b\r\n\r\nAnimations:\r\nMixamo Animator\r\n\r\nCharacter Creation:\r\nAdobe Fuse Trial (Advisors 1, 2, 3, Doctor, Worried wife, and injured player)\r\nAutodesk Character Generator\r\n\r\nMinute-Maid Park: Football Setup\r\nhttps://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=u7770072b-f86c-4a44-8a63-85dcad4240a7\r\n\r\nLow Poly 3D Man (Rigged with Mixamo)\r\nhttps://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=cf0116fd7302f7dfb0e3f4dd541ba755\r\n\r\nKyle XY Trager House\r\nhttps://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=11fc95f6f8f6efd84f52551bb6d0494\r\n\r\nDoctorâ€™s Office\r\nhttps://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model.html?id=9646723bbf608fb871863225e6cc4ec5\r\n\r\nAudio:\r\nhttps://acapela-box.com/AcaBox/index.php\r\n\r\nClassic Skybox Asset:\r\nhttps://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/24923\r\n\r\nSportsCenter logo for home television:\r\nhttp://cdn1.thecomeback.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/94/2014/02/sclogo.jpg",
